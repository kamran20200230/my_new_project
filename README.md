# Performing Object Detection with ImageAI

Now let's see how to actually use the ImageAI library. I'll explain step by step how you can build your first object detection model with ImageAI.
Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Describe briefly in 2-3 sentences what your project is about. About 250 characters is a nice length! 


## Background
|Our first task here is to create the necessary folders. For this tutorial we need the following folders:

Object detection: root folder
models: stores pre-trained model
input: stores image file on which we want to perform object detection
output: stores image file with detected objects




## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
